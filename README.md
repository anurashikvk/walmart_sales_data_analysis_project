# walmart_sales_data_analysis_project
I recently completed a comprehensive data analysis project on Walmart's sales dataset, aiming to provide valuable insights into the sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
## Project Overview

### About

The project focused on analyzing the Walmart Sales dataset obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition. The dataset comprised sales transactions from three Walmart branches in different locations, featuring various columns such as invoice_id, branch, city, customer_type, product_line, unit_price, quantity, and more.

### Purposes

The primary objectives were to understand the sales patterns across different branches, analyze product performance, and identify customer preferences to optimize sales strategies and enhance overall profitability.

### Analysis List

1. Product Analysis
2. Sales Analysis
3. Customer Analysis

## Key Steps

### Data Wrangling

- Built a database and created tables for analysis.
- Ensured the data integrity by handling missing or NULL values.

### Feature Engineering

- Derived additional insights by creating new columns such as `time_of_day`, `day_name`, and `month_name` from existing data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted thorough analysis to address various business questions related to product, sales, and customer segments.

## Business Questions Explored
